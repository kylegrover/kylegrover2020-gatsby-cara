## Web Developer, Web Designer, Webmaster...

> My greatest asset is my breadth of knowledge, and a head that fits many hats

Years of experience working with small businesses and busy agencies have taught me a wide range of skills, ranging from web server deployment and project management, to video editing and copy writing - and of course I have my bases covered with solid web fundamentals, including modern CSS3, HTML5, ES6 Javascript, PHP7, and much more. For more info about my specific tech stack and work experience check out <a href="/resume/">my online resume</a>.

When I’m not making websites and drinking lots of coffee or tea, I’m probably exploring new digital art mediums, playing indie video games, or <span style="text-decoration: line-through">checking out some local music</span> quarantining.

I’m available for freelance work, check out my <a href="/services/">web development services</a>.
